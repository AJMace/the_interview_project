<p>Seth Aaron Rogen; born April 15, 1982) is a Canadian actor, screenwriter, producer, director, and comedian. Rogen began his career performing stand-up comedy during his teenage years, winning the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest in 1998. While still living in his native Vancouver, he landed a supporting role in the series Freaks and Geeks. Rogen later got a part on the equally short-lived sitcom Undeclared, which also hired him as a staff writer.As a child, Rogen did not want to pursue any career other than comedy: "As soon as I realized you could be funny as a job, that was the job I wanted".</p>
